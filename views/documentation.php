<h3>Welcome to Notes plugin.</h3>

<p>
    The sole purpose of this plugin is to take notes within WolfCMS.
</p>
<p>
    I have created this because I'm toooo lazy to write notes on paper and I needed it for maintenance purposes.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
    Well, it's pretty simple to use this plugin as it doesn't have to many options. All you can do for the moment is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>create new note</li>
    <li>edit and delete existing note</li>
    <li>view all notes</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For text styling use normal html tags.
</p>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<p>
    As any other plugin, this one has plenty of room for improvement. Some of them are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>sorting by different criteria</li>
    <li>textile filter input (maybe)</li>
    <li>some sort of priority checkboxes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues and Wishes</h2>
